# Dear void I hardly knew thee

It has been a while since I showed the `void log` some love.  Work has been busy and I just didn't really have the motivation to work on any personal projects.  Which happens to me sometimes.  In my younger days I would fill that void with unhealthy amounts video games.  But I am a grown ass man now.  So I fill that void with unhealthy amounts of alcohol, drugs, and video games.  I do that until after many months of my brain swimming in soup, I all of the sudden get the urge to spend more time on code only I will ever see and only I will ever use.  This entry is mainly for briefly explaining where I have been and what I plan to write about in the next few entries.  

## Where I have been

None of your business.  

## What's next

Before I go into what's next I guess I should mention that I did switch the data solution for this blog.  You can see the git diff in this {#98c379}([pr](https://github.com/gabrielgrover/improved-octo-spoon/pull/3/files)).  Long story short `PlanetScale`'s free tier is cringe and the next paid tier is cringe, especially for a simple blog.  I have a container that is running a `CoucDB` instance and that is where comments are stored now.  So go ahead and write something so I can justify the stupid amount of time I spent on it.  

So what's next?  Well like every other dev that is perpetually online I got rust FOMO.  Also, all of the dev influencers I watch now seem to be saying if you all you write is `JavaScript` then you will never be cool.  I CANNOT HAVE THAT.  So I decided to build a Password manager application with {#98c379}([tauri](https://tauri.app/)).  Which basically is electron but... rust.  If you just want to see the code you can do that {#98c379}([here](https://github.com/gabrielgrover/fizzgig)).  It's a lot of code.  Have fun making sense of it. Till next time.
