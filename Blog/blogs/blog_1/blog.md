### Introduction

Greetings!  Welcome to my small corner of the great void.  My name is Gabriel.  I am a software engineer. Right now my work involves a lot of TypeScript, but I know several languages.  A few weeks ago an old friend of mine asked if he could come by my house with some beers and get advice from me on how to break into the tech industry.  I told him as long as he brought `Miller Lite` then I would oblige him.  It was a long conversation, but one of the things I suggested to him was that he should make a portfolio site to showcase his knowledge and projects.  As soon as I suggested that to him I realized I did not have one myself.  In fact I have never had one.  That suggestion is just something I have heard repeated over the years.  So, I have decided to do the brave thing and follow my own / everyone else's advice!  So welcome to my very own bonified `void log`.


### Goal(s)

My main goal for the `void log` is knowledge sharing.  When I have learned something interesting I want to record exactly what I learned and cast it out into the great void.  Like my very own  {blue}([Voyager Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record))!  The secondary goal will be to showcase specific projects that I am working on.  Be they personal projects or work projects. 

### What is next?

The current time since epoch is `1666995064287`, and NextJS just finished a big conference.  Watch all the nerds and cringe {blue}([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiknNI_0J48)).  Jokes aside there are some pretty cool new features that have been added to NextJS, and I want to explore them.  In fact this very `void log` was built with it. So the next `void log` will be a detailed account of how I put it all together and what I find cool and interesting about the new features NextJS is offering.  

### Fin

In conclusion I hope this `void log` can be of service to you.  Until we meet again.  Blessings [`null surfer`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJPFfpiI4ZQ).
